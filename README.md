### SpatialTransformers

Spatial Transformers help the model to increase the Geometric Invariance. For ex:- if the Images are tilted or need to be sclaed. These are networks that can be easily added to any model and they teach Models on how to perform spatial transformations on the input image. It is very useful with CNN's as CNN's are NOT invariant to affine transformations.
